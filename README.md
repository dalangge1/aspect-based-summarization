# Summarizing Text on Any Aspects:A Knowledge-Informed Weakly-Supervised Approach

*code coming soon...*

Statistics: the size of constructed dataset depends on the number of aspects we picked from each (document, summary) pair. 
For example, the size of CNN/DM training set is 300K, if we pick 10 aspects on each example, then the constructed dataset will be 3M (document, aspect, summary) triples.

The constructed dataset is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ZeJsxyottRyvfzguedoET7OFkWSgJJK/view?usp=sharing).
