# Summarizing Text on Any Aspects:A Knowledge-Informed Weakly-Supervised Approach

*code coming soon...*

Statistics: the size of constructed dataset depends on the number of aspects we picked from each (document, summary) pair. 
For example, the size of CNN/DM training set is 300K, if we pick 4 aspects on each example, then the size of constructed dataset will be 1200K.

[example.json](example.json) is a tiny demo set of constructed training examples with our weakly supervised approach.
